# Keaton Davies 2025 Graduate
## Full Stack Engineering since 2024!

Hello, I am Keaton Davies. I've been working on getting my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science since 2022. I've had a long road and I've had plenty of setbacks. This is my professional reflection on my work that I've done throughout this course. I've attempted this Capstone three times now. The first time I tried I had my hard drive fail. The second time I had my Aunt die. This time I've had a CPU fan fail but that didn't stop me this time. I've pushed through and that alone speaks to my perseverance. This has been a marathon and not a sprint in my case. Outside of my course work I've built several small goofy python scripts. One of which is a little discord bot that responds when specific words are used in a chat, and another is a D&D stat generator that 'rolls' six sets of three six sided dice to determine a character's stats. In my professional work I am currently working at a Non-profit where I am an IT Specialist II and part of a very small IT team. I manage a little bit of everything from printer issues all the way up to major outages alongside our Director and the other two IT specialists. 

## Collaboration
When it comes to collaborating with others in a team environment I focus on the following: Empathy, Adaptability, and Proactive Support. These are the cornerstones to how I handle problems. I am able to work with my peers that might not have the same technical aptitude and I help provide them the support they need in order to get their work done. Adaptability is also important because no matter what happens there can always be a different solution to the same problem and no one is just like the other when it comes to computer knowledge and ability and so I can adjust how I describe a problem based on what they bring to the table. Lastly would be my Proactive support, oftentimes individuals see IT as a moneysink in most corporate settings, which it can be, but IT also is the main line of defense. Proactive support is identifying issues before they become major problems which is what I excel at. I keep a strong vigil and I work to make sure that when an end user has a problem I've got at least one solution if not several.

## Communication 
Communicating with Stakeholders is a bit different for me than when I am collaborating. I still feel like the above work but I also want to hone my focus on ensuring that communication is clear and reports follow what they are looking for. It doesn't help to provide a several page ticket report if they only wanted to know information about why a specific issue had been left to languish for a day. I also work to build the idea of me as a reliable source of information. I am not shy of explaining that I currently don't have an answer but I would be happy to research and find one if I don't. Lastly, I work to make sure that my suggestions, changes and proposals all fall within our businesses current objectives. I recently helped decide on the purchase of several laptops for our growing Adult Education sector that we've been building over the last year.

## Data Structure and Algorithms 
A deep understanding of data structures and algorithms has been fundamental to my growth as a Full Stack Developer. Through various coursework and projects, I learned how to apply efficient algorithms and choose the right data structures to optimize performance in both front-end and back-end development. For example, I used hashes to create well-defined user login security. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills, enabling me to write clean, optimized code that improves the overall user experience and system performance. My ePortfolio showcases my course-work from my Full-Stack Developement Class (CS465), highlighting my ability to solve complex problemsâ€”a critical skill that makes me more employable in competitive development roles. During this Capstone I went ahead and refactored my original code and made sure that it was both functional and elegant.

## Software Engineering and Databases
My coursework in computer science provided me with essential skills, including proficiency in modern web frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end design. On the back end, I gained experience building robust APIs and integrating them with NoSQL databases, ensuring scalable and efficient data management. I also became proficient in using Git for version control and collaborating in Agile environments, allowing me to contribute effectively to team projects. My database knowledge was applied in MongoDB for flexible, unstructured data storage. The project featured in my ePortfolio, demonstrating my ability to develop end-to-end solutions that balance performance, maintainability, and user experience. This full-stack expertise, paired with strong software engineering principles, positions me as a capable and adaptable developer ready for real-world challenges.
